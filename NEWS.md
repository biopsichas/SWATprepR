# SWATprepR 1.0.3

-   Warning for `load_template()`, if there are duplicates in the template file.
-   Sorting in weather files using `prepare_climate()`. Needed for SWAT+ model to find weather files correctly.
-   Added function `find_dif()` to compare files of two setups and find differences.

# SWATprepR 1.0.2
