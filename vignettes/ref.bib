abstract = {This study describes a source apportionment methodology for riverine nitrogen transport. A statistical model was developed relating stream nitrogen load to spatially referenced nitrogen sources and basin characteristics. It is able to estimate the nitrogen load on the basis of only three parameters. It considers applied fertiliser, atmospheric deposition and point discharges as sources and rainfall, topography and water flow as basin characteristics. The model was calibrated on three European watersheds, the Wash (UK), the Zelivka (Czech Republic) and the Vilaine (France) river basins in order to represent a range of different climatic characteristics and nitrogen input pressures. Based on model predictions, the spatial and temporal variations of diffuse nitrogen emission were described, identifying critical areas more prone to nitrogen loss. The model makes it possible to estimate the contribution of each nitrogen sources (point and diffuse) to the total river load. Finally, scenarios of different nitrogen input pressure were analysed. The model was shown to be a suitable tool for understanding the fate of the actual nitrogen input pressure and evaluating the impact of alternative management strategies with a limited data requirement.}

abstract = {{Input data collection, quality assurance and preparation are central but time\_consuming steps in environmental modeling. Errors due to manual processing of model input data can result in an incorrect representation of an environmental system and may consequently lead to implausible model simulations. Correct input data preparation and thorough quality check at an early stage of the model setup procedure are essential to build confidence in model simulation results. Typically, in environmental model applications, many steps in the input data preparation phase have to be repeated with the inflow of new, additional or corrected data. In this study, we selected the widely used SWAT + ecohydrological model as an illustrative example to investigate challenges related to input data preparation. To assist in these tasks, we developed an R package named SWATprepR, which provides functions for typical and repeating SWAT + model input data preparation tasks. The package supports the preparation of weather input files, atmospheric deposition, soil parameters, crop rotations, and observed (control or calibration) data, to name a few, presently with focus on European applications. The SWATprepR functions are integrated in R script workflows and can help SWAT + modelers to avoid repetitive tasks, secure reproducibility and transparently document the data processing steps. Application of the package is illustrated with a test case of a SWAT + model for a small catchment in central Poland.}},

abstract = {{The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) is applied worldwide for modeling basin-scale processes. Its latest version (SWAT+) adds new capabilities to the tool, and collectively with increasing computational power and availability of public datasets expands model complexity as well as provides pathways for serious errors in the model setup process. These models are used to run scenarios to support decision-making processes, hence undetected faults can have a substantial socio-economic and environmental impact. We propose a 5-step SWAT+ model setup verification workflow assessing the soundness of processes related to weather, water balance, management, plant growth, point source and tile drain flows. We developed an R package, called SWATdoctR, which guides the user through the model setup verification process, allowing the identification of typical, but repeatedly overlooked, issues. The workflow and the functionality of the tool is demonstrated in 4 SWAT+ setups in different catchments, at various stages of model setup.}},

abstract = {{Soil hydraulic properties are often derived indirectly, i.e. computed from easily available soil properties with pedotransfer functions (PTFs), when those are needed for catchment, regional or continental scale applications. When predicted soil hydraulic parameters are used for the modelling of the state and flux of water in soils, uncertainty of the computed values can provide more detailed information when drawing conclusions. The aim of this study was to update the previously published European PTFs (Tóth et al., 2015, euptf v1.4.0) by providing prediction uncertainty calculation built into the transfer functions. The new set of algorithms was derived for point predictions of soil water content at saturation (0 cm matric potential head), field capacity (both -100 and -330 cm matric potential head), wilting point (-15 000 cm matric potential head), plant available water, and saturated hydraulic conductivity, as well as the Mualem–van Genuchten model parameters of the moisture retention and hydraulic conductivity curve. The minimum set of input properties for the prediction is soil depth and sand, silt and clay content. The effect of including additional information like soil organic carbon content, bulk density, calcium carbonate content, pH and cation exchange capacity were extensively analysed. The PTFs were derived adopting the random forest method. The advantage of the new PTFs is that they (i) provide information about prediction uncertainty, (ii) are significantly more accurate than the euptfv1, (iii) can be applied for more predictor variable combinations than the euptfv1, 32 instead of 5, and (iv) are now also derived for the prediction of water content at -100 cm matric potential head and plant available water content. A practical guidance on how to use the derived PTFs is provided.}},
